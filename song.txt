I
Ukraine's freedom has not yet perished, nor has her glory,
Upon us, fellow Ukrainians, fate shall smile once more.
Our enemies will vanish like dew in the sun,
And we too shall rule, brothers, in a free land of our own.

Chorus:
We'll lay down our souls and bodies to attain our freedom,
And we'll show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation!

II
Brethren, stand together in a bloody fight, from the Sian to the Don
We will not allow others to rule in our native land.
The Black Sea will smile and grandfather Dnipro will rejoice,
For in our own Ukraine fortune shall flourish again.

Chorus

III
Our persistence and our sincere toils will be rewarded,
And freedom's song will resound throughout all of Ukraine.
Echoing off the Carpathians, and rumbling across the steppes,
Ukraine's fame and glory will be known among all nations.
