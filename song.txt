I
Ukraine's freedom has not yet perished, nor has her glory,
Upon us, fellow Ukrainians, fate shall smile once more.
Our enemies will vanish like dew in the sun,
And we too shall rule, brothers, in a free land of our own.

Chorus:
We'll lay down our souls and bodies to attain our freedom,
And we'll show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation!
